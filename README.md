# Javascript-Calculator
Calculator in vanilla JS, CSS, and HTML. I deployed to Heroku using PHP, but I plan to go back and redo the deployment by setting up Node.

Currently the calculator returns "Infinity" when dividing by zero. This needs to be corrected. I also need to add the ability to work with negative numbers. 

In the future I will add more advanced mathematical functionality.
